# Service Card Hover Animation with Tailwind CSS and Anime.js

This project demonstrates a responsive service card layout using **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Anime.js** for smooth hover animations. The icons within each service card are styled to appear half-outside of their respective boxes, creating a visually appealing 3D effect when hovered.

## Features

- **Responsive Grid Layout**: The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile views using Tailwind's grid system.
- **Hover Animations**: The service cards rotate smoothly on the Y-axis when hovered over, thanks to Anime.js.
- **Circular Icons**: Icons are placed inside circles, positioned slightly outside the top of each service box, giving a modern design touch.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building fast and responsive UIs.
- **FontAwesome**: For the use of scalable vector icons.
- **Anime.js**: A lightweight JavaScript animation library that powers the hover effects.
- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the service cards.
